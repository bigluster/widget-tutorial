Make yourself familiar with the Widget editor:
- Open 
•	Create a new widget in the Widget library “widget-exercises”
•	Add some “Hello world” in the HTML area and add some formatting in the CSS/Less area
(Always use CSS classes instead of IDs, so .my-formatting instead of #my-object)
•	Save the Widget
•	Move your widget to a new library
•	Make some modifications (e.g. just add a space) and move the copy back to the library “widget-exercises”
•	Use your newly created Widget in an existing app 
(do not forget to refresh the browser to get the updated list of Widgets)
•	Etc.
