title: Custom properties
---

As we now know how to bind properties to the widget output, let's create some custom properties.

One of the essential concepts behind widgets is that the widget creator can define how the widget instance can be configured by the end-user.
Therefore - as a Widget creator - you can define properties, which define the behavior of your widget and which can then be used by the user.

## Helper for the following exercises

As a little helper for the following exercises use the existing widget called "Exercise-CustomProperties" from widget library "widget-exercises".

This provides some CSS and a little code snippet which makes it easier to output some values:

```html
<div class="widget-properties">

	<!-- Copy from here ...-->
	<div class="row">
		<div class="label">
			<!-- Your label goes here -->
		</div>
		<div class="val">
			<!-- Your value goes here -->
		</div>
	</div>
	<!-- ... to here -->
	
</div>
```


## Exercise 1: Create a basic input field

- Create a basic input field
- Render the value of the input field in your widget

## Exercise 2: Create a drop-down

- Create a property using the drop-down type
- Render the selected value in your widget

## Exercise 3: Create a drop-down and create a binding in CSS
